# Disease Prediction Web Application

## Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based application for disease prediction using machine learning models. The application provides a platform for doctors to input patient parameters and receive predictions on whether the patient has a particular disease or not. It utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for prediction and is built using Flask for the web framework and SQLite3 for database management.

## Features

- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes a Random Forest machine learning model trained on historical patient data to predict disease outcomes based on input parameters.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive web interface for doctors to input patient parameters and view predictions.
- **Database Management**: Uses SQLite3 for managing patient data and storing prediction results.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle small to medium-scale usage, with potential for scalability as the application grows.
- **Security**: Implements basic security measures to protect sensitive patient data and ensure confidentiality.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- SQLite3
